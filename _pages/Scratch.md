:exclamation: **<span style="color:red">Important: </span> PLEASE READ BEFORE USE**

This project implements a minimum set of common utilities including:
`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `clear`, `uptime`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `vim`, `history`, `list` - (under development)

To launch each, just type on terminal.

>**NOTE 1:**
`delete/backspace` key is replaced by `left` key due to Scratch's limitation.
    
>**NOTE 2:**
:warning: Warning: **ANY CREATED FILE IS VOLATILE**.
The simulated file system (:sparkles: yes! This project contains a toy version of file system :sparkles:) cannot hold any data once the <span style="color:red">RED</span> button is clicked. Every time when <span style="color:green">GREEN</span> flag is clicked, a clean and fresh new file system is generated.
    
>**NOTE 3:**
Currently no flags/options are supported for tools/utilities except necessary `path/name` string is needed by: 
`cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `vim`

>**NOTE 4:**
build-in games: snake game is under `home` directory.
How to launch? After <span style="color:green">GREEN</span> flag:
1. type `ls` and hit `enter` -> you will see `games` directory.
2. type `cd games` and hit `enter` to change directory to games
3. repeat 1. to see a file called `snake`
4. type `./snake` to launch the game and have fun!
