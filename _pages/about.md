Hello! I recently graduated with a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of California, Riverside ([UCR](https://www.ucr.edu/)), where I was deeply involved in research under the supervision of [Dr. Hung-Wei Tseng](https://intra.engr.ucr.edu/~htseng/) in the Extreme Storage & Computer Architecture Laboratory ([ESCAL](https://www.escalab.org/)). Currently, I am a Research Associate with the Computational Science Initiative at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

I completed my Master’s degree in Computer and Communication Engineering at National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, in 2016, under the guidance of [Dr. Chung-Ho Chen](https://researchoutput.ncku.edu.tw/en/persons/chung-ho-chen). I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the same institution in 2014, graduating with a CGPA of 3.91/4.00. I also had the enriching experience of being an exchange student at Auburn University in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department during Fall 2013.
